# PythonRockPaperScissors
Creator: Ben Mighall

A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in Python demonstrating basic functionality of the language.

The game plays in the command line as a 2-player match; first to three points is the winner. It has simple input validation to ensure that the users must enter a correct response to proceed. Other than that, it's pretty self-explanatory. 

One small change I made after turning the program in was using a Python function to trigger a "clear" command in the command line window; this way, the game is actually playable by two players without the second player getting a substantial advantage. I included the commands to clear the window for Linux/Mac enabled by default. (If you're on Windows, you should be able to change that to "cls" and have it work fine, but I didn't test that functionality.)

I can't do anything about cheating (screen/keyboard peeking or pressing keys to see what previous entries were), so honor system applies, I suppose. 

This program was written for University of Mississippi course EL E 237 (Electrical Engineering Tools and Toys).
